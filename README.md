This repo contains an example project that demonstrates usage of Angular 1.5, Typescript 2.1 and Gulp 3.9 together.
It is a simple web that uses TMDB (the movie database) API to displays the most popular movies and allows the user to search through the database.  

## Installation

If you don't have Gulp installed on your machine you should first install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ npm install gulp -g
```

Then you need to navigate to the root folder and install all dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To run the project use the following command:

```bash
$ gulp serve
```
